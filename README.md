## 3. Bitcoin price analysis ##
This empirical section of my bachelor's thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin's market trends using Excel and gretl. The focus was on practical insights, employing a regression analysis that links Bitcoin prices to economic indicators such as inflation, Reference Rate, Consumer Confidence Index, WIG20, DJIA, and gold prices. This project showcases my practical skills in data analysis and modeling.

## 4. Others ##
Those projects mainly contain files that were created as a result of my learning Python in the field of data analysis.
